HTML:
1. Heading elements - <h1> to <h6> tags.
2. Paragraph elements - <p></p>
3. Self closing tags - <hr/> & <br/>
4. List elements - Ordered and unordered lists.
    Unordered List: - One of the most famous. Creates bullet points. Order of items do not matter.
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

    Ordered List - If the order of the list items matter then:
        <ol>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
5. Nesting and Identation: - For instance you can list list items inside an unordered or ordered list as above. One can also nest a list inside another list. This is when identation becomes key in your code so by looking at your code you can easily tell the code has multiple lists, lists inside lists for readability.
6. Anchor Tag - Uses <a></a> however it is not an active anchor tag unless the href attribute is added into it as:
   <a href="http://www.google.com">This is a link to Google</a>
   An attribute adds more information e.g what the link should be redirecting to.
   Attributes can be either tag specific eg href or global e.g draggable=true

7. Image Tag - <img /> is a self closing tag/void element. Similar to the anchor tag, it must have an attribute for it to work as expected. Should be as below:
   <img src="url" />
   Tells where the image location.
   After the url, you can specify the size of the image as:
   <img src="https://picsum.photos/200"/> The 200 means the image will be in a 200 * 200 square.
   Other attribute is alt - for alternative text description. This can be used by the screen reader used by the blind/ people with visual imparament.
   On the image you can use jpg, png or even gifs

8. To be a good programmer you need to make coding a habbit. Can achieve this by marking a line on your calendar.
9. Computer File Path - Think of it as a unique location in a computer hard drive. Can redirect someone to a file or a folder.
    a. Absolute File paths - Is a file path relative to the root of the computer.
    b. Relative File paths - More useful in web development. It is relative to something. If writing our code in the project folder, we write it relative to the location we are writting our code. They are usually shorter. Better since if the project folder is moved, the relative path will still be valid.
    c. Some other characters that make it easier to navigate include:
        ../ - Means go back a level then go to whichever path you want to navigate to. Travel up the tree,
        ./ -  stay in the current directory. Better approach that accessing the file without the ./ since the direct approach may not work at times.
10. Webpages - Different content can be captured in different pages. The file path navigation and anchor tag concepts plays a key role when it comes to naviagting to the different pages. 
    The public folder usually contains all the pages that are not the home page.

11. HTML Boilerplate - Helps understand the structure of html files. Similar to a letter structure, HTML files should follow a specific structure, famously reffered to as the HTML boilerplate:
    
<!DOCTYPE html>  - The declaration helps the browser know the version of html the code was written in. (this is for html 5)
<html lang="en"> - Is the html element. lang is the language of the text within the the htm tag.
    <head> - Important information about our website that will allow the site render correctly is placed here. Won't be displayed to the user. No content goes here. Includes meta tag and title.
        <meta charset="UTF-8"> - Ensures the characters in the site get displayed correctly. Some might not allow emoji, or symbols like division, the meta tag controls this. UTF-8 is one of the common one to use.
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> - Defines how the website should be displayed relative to the screen it is being displayed on.
        <title>My Website</title> - Gets displayed on the tab bar.
    </head>
    <body> - Where all the website content goes. Content and structure basically goes here.
        <h1>Hello World!</h1> - Sample content.
    </body>
</html>

12. Webhosting - Is the process of making your website available to any one over the internet. The entire project must be put on a web server connected to the internet.
13. Capstone projects - When interviewing any developer, one looks at their portfolio and what they have been able to do. Github plays a key role for from it one can tell the developer's portfolio and their activities. How often they have been uploading code to github.  Capstone projects will allow test your skills and at the end, one would have done lot's of personal projects that will standout from  everyone else inspite taking a similar course or been in the sam boot camp.
14. CSS - Stands for cascading style sheet where cascading refers to the approach of creating the styling in some sort of a water fall starting with the general styling to the most specific styling. Style Sheet - is a language similar to the markup language in html. There are different types of style sheet languages but for our case we will consider the cascading style sheet.
    Initially, In HTML 3 for formating and styling, various tags were added including, center, font, border etc which have since been deprecated. With such the code was a bit messed up and would be impossible to differentiate the content from the styling. This saw the recommendation of use of CSS to allow the separation of styling from content.
15. Adding CSS - We can add css in either of the three ways:
    1.  Inline - <tag style="css"> - Goes to the opening line of the tag. Uses the style attribute which has the property and the value of the property. e.g: <html style="background: blue"> </html>. This is however very tedious when working with several elements. It is therefore not recommended. - Used when targeting a single element
    2.  Internal - <style>css</style> - Done using special html tag called the style element:
            <html>
                <head>
                    <style>
                    html {
                        background: red;
                    }
                    </style>
                </head>
            </html>
            This can be used on any of the elements. All you need to add is a selector. The selector comes before the openning and closing curly braces. In the above the selector is html.
            -Used when targeting a single webpage.
    3.  External - <link href="style"> - With this approach, a file is created purely for creating all the styling and then called in between the <head></head> element. to add the css to the main file:
        <html>
            <head>
                <link rel = "stylesheet" href = "./styles.css">
            </head>
        </html>
    - Used when targeting an entire website with all its multiple web pages.
  
16. CSS Selectors - Through the property and value we can specify css rules. A CSS selector is the part that bundles the rules together e.g h1 in the below css:
    h1 {
        color: blue
    }
    - A CSS Selector is the path that selects the html in order to apply whichever rule that goes into the curly braces. 
    - An element selctor - selects/targets a specific html tag. It will select all elements of the selected tag.
    - Class selectors - use a . and any random name as the selector. e.g.
        .red-text {
            color: red
        }

        A class can then be added as an attribute to your elements for ablove: <h2 class="red-text">Red</h2>
        A class selector is really versatile for anables you to manipulate different elements in your web pages.
    - Id Selector - Uses the hash tag. It selects all the elements with a particular id attribute. Works similar to the class selector.
    - The difference btn the class and id selectors is:
      - The class selector can be added to many elements while the id selector should be applied to one element in a single html file. So if you have multiple <h2> elements and would like to add some different styling, the id selector would be best suited.
    - Attribute selector - We can add multiple attributes to an html tag e.g., <h1 id="" class="" draggable=""> etc. We can select elements that have particular attributes using below notation:
        h1[draggable] {
            color: red
        }
    this will select all h1 elements with attribute draggable and set the color to red.
    One can also be more specific and check the value of the property draggable as:

    <p draggable="true">Drag Me</p>
    <p draggable="false">Con't Drag Me</p>

    The css:
        p[draggable="false"] {
            color: red;
        }

    - Universal selector uses the asterisk. Which basically select all where the style sheet is active:
        * {
            color: red
          }

17. CSS Color properties - formated as property:value e.g., background-color:red or color:blue. These are name colors that can be found on the developer documentation on 
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/CSS/named-color. 
    
    As much as there are multiple colors available, you might want to work with a particular color palettes. One of the most popular ones being color hunt:
    https://colorhunt.co

    A free tool created by designers for designers shows the colors that work together perfectly. The colors have numbers and letters referred to as hexadecimal used to represent longer numbers. E.g purple can be represented as #5D3891 = rgb(93,56,145). The code can be used as an alternative to the name as:
        h1 {
            color: #5D3891
        }
    
18. Font Size - we can change various properties on our elements. For font we can use various properties including:
    1.  font-weight - can either be normal or bold. e.g., h1 {font-weight: normal}
            Bolder/Lighter - It can also be changed relative to the parent by using keewords bolder or lighter as values. Lighter less the weight by 100 while bolder makes it bolder by 100
            number - can also use a number between 100 and 900 to specify how bold you want it to be. 1q00 being the lighest and 900 the boldest.
    2.  font-size - can be changed as h1 {font-size:20px}. 1px = 1/96th inch or 0.26 mm which is absolutely tiny. Can also be represented in:
        a. points (1pt = 1/72nd inch or 0.35mm). 
        b. 1em - 100% of parent. This means if we set an <h1> tag to a font-size of 1em, and it is wrapped around a body tag with font-size:20px then the font-size of the <h1> will be 20px. if 2em then h1 will be set to 40px.
            <body style = "font-size: 20px">
                <h1 style = "font-size: 1em"> Hello World </h1>
            </body>

        c. 1rem - 100% of root. Works similar to the 1em but instead of being relative to the parent, it is relative to the root of the html file. With the html boiler plate, the root is always set to <html></html>. For 1rem, a change on its parent does not affect its size but if the root in this case the <html> tag font-size is changed, it will translate to an automatic change on the rem font sizes.

        Recommended to use the rem instead of using the em to avoid the confusion as a result of change of the size of elements.

    3.  font-family - Determines what you want your text to look like. e.g, font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif. 
        The first which is a Helvetica, is a mac font which might not be supported in some operating systems. Therefore, often in addition to the font name, a second value (generic font type). The san-serif usually has no decorations at the bottom but the edges of the letters are always at right angles. This means Mac users will see the Helvetica font while windows users will see an equivalent to Helvetica which in this case is sans-serif.

        if the type has more than one word e.g., Times New Roman, it must be specified in between double quotes to tell css there are spaces in the font family. Times New Roman being a serif, the backup should be set as so.

        To use a specific custom font in your project:
        Navigate to https://fonts.google.com/ select the specific font then click on it then click to select the specific weight that you intend to us. This will create specific links that you can then copy into the header section of your project and then use the fonts to your liking.
        Some of the generic fonts include:
            a. Helvetica
            b. arial
            c. Serif
            d. Sans serif
            e. cursive
            f. Monospace
            g. Fantasy

    4. Text Align - with this you can align text to the left, center, right, start (when you have text that is written from right to left e.g., in arabic) or end. Can check it out on MDN Docs.
    
 19. Inspecting CSS - When inspecting elements, one can easily play around with the styling, by adding new css elements, or modifying the already in place css. However, this does not affect the original source code. Can best be used to test out new features before effecting them on actual code.
    - When inspecting elements, on styles you will notice some of the css striked through. This is mostly because they have been overwritten by other custom code. If the custom styling for say the anchor tag is removed, then the default code is automatically activated.
    - To know they kind of formating applied to you code without the cancelled lines of code, use the computed tab of the inspected elements.
    - Sometimes you may come across a website you really like and would love to get an overview of what the styling is. To access such info, click the three dots on the developer tools (Not the chrome one), then click on more tools then click on CSS overview. This will show the background colors on your web page, the various fonts in use 

20. The Box Model (Margin, Padding and Border) - The three together with width and height form a very important concept known as the box model. Every element in a website is a box that can be changed by changing the width and height. 
    In adjusting, you can either use pixels or percentages. Can also set a border on the box with 3 values separated by space e.g., border: 10px solid black. Changing the border size does not change the size of the box. The border grows outwards and not inward. Can set different boarder values using the border-top, border-bottom etc. Or use the value border-with 0px 10px 20px 30px - This works in a clockwise marner starting at the top with 0px and the last value being assigned to the left as 30px.

    Can also set the top and bottom, left and right using the format:
        boarder-width: 0px 20px; - Top and bottom will be set to 0px while the other will be set to 20px.

    Padding - To the box, if padding is set to 20px, it will push the border out by 20px. The hight and width of the box does not change.
    Margin - is the part that is outside of the boarder. The margin is between the boarder and any other element on the screen. 
    
    From the outmost, the box model is as below:

                    Margin
                      |
                    border
                      |
                    Padding
                      |
        height & Width containing the content

    Padding and margin functions similar to the border styling  can use margin, margin-top, margin-bottom and margin-width 0px 10px 20px 30px. Same to padding.

    Other than boxes created by elements, we can also create our own elements. We use the content Division Element - DIV as <div> </div>
    They can take as many elements as you'd wish. This are usually invisible on the website and can at times be difficult to debug. To dubug such, you can use a free chrome extension <Pesticide Chrome Extension>. This will help diagnose what is wrong with your box model when it goes wrong.

    For p tags by default the element has a margin of 1em. If no margin is needed, always good practice to set the margin to zero for all <p></p>

    if not sure how any of the elements works, if you hover on it, VS code has a way of redirecting you to the MDN Docs where you can learn more about the element.
