HTML:
1. Heading elements - <h1> to <h6> tags.
2. Paragraph elements - <p></p>
3. Self closing tags - <hr/> & <br/>
4. List elements - Ordered and unordered lists.
    Unordered List: - One of the most famous. Creates bullet points. Order of items do not matter.
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

    Ordered List - If the order of the list items matter then:
        <ol>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
5. Nesting and Identation: - For instance you can list list items inside an unordered or ordered list as above. One can also nest a list inside another list. This is when identation becomes key in your code so by looking at your code you can easily tell the code has multiple lists, lists inside lists for readability.
6. Anchor Tag - Uses <a></a> however it is not an active anchor tag unless the href attribute is added into it as:
   <a href="http://www.google.com">This is a link to Google</a>
   An attribute adds more information e.g what the link should be redirecting to.
   Attributes can be either tag specific eg href or global e.g draggable=true

7. Image Tag - <img /> is a self closing tag/void element. Similar to the anchor tag, it must have an attribute for it to work as expected. Should be as below:
   <img src="url" />
   Tells where the image location.
   After the url, you can specify the size of the image as:
   <img src="https://picsum.photos/200"/> The 200 means the image will be in a 200 * 200 square.
   Other attribute is alt - for alternative text description. This can be used by the screen reader used by the blind/ people with visual imparament.
   On the image you can use jpg, png or even gifs

8. To be a good programmer you need to make coding a habbit. Can achieve this by marking a line on your calendar.
9. Computer File Path - Think of it as a unique location in a computer hard drive. Can redirect someone to a file or a folder.
    a. Absolute File paths - Is a file path relative to the root of the computer.
    b. Relative File paths - More useful in web development. It is relative to something. If writing our code in the project folder, we write it relative to the location we are writting our code. They are usually shorter. Better since if the project folder is moved, the relative path will still be valid.
    c. Some other characters that make it easier to navigate include:
        ../ - Means go back a level then go to whichever path you want to navigate to. Travel up the tree,
        ./ -  stay in the current directory. Better approach that accessing the file without the ./ since the direct approach may not work at times.
10. Webpages - Different content can be captured in different pages. The file path navigation and anchor tag concepts plays a key role when it comes to naviagting to the different pages. 
    The public folder usually contains all the pages that are not the home page.

11. HTML Boilerplate - Helps understand the structure of html files. Similar to a letter structure, HTML files should follow a specific structure, famously reffered to as the HTML boilerplate:
    
<!DOCTYPE html>  - The declaration helps the browser know the version of html the code was written in. (this is for html 5)
<html lang="en"> - Is the html element. lang is the language of the text within the the htm tag.
    <head> - Important information about our website that will allow the site render correctly is placed here. Won't be displayed to the user. No content goes here. Includes meta tag and title.
        <meta charset="UTF-8"> - Ensures the characters in the site get displayed correctly. Some might not allow emoji, or symbols like division, the meta tag controls this. UTF-8 is one of the common one to use.
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> - Defines how the website should be displayed relative to the screen it is being displayed on.
        <title>My Website</title> - Gets displayed on the tab bar.
    </head>
    <body> - Where all the website content goes. Content and structure basically goes here.
        <h1>Hello World!</h1> - Sample content.
    </body>
</html>

12. Webhosting - Is the process of making your website available to any one over the internet. The entire project must be put on a web server connected to the internet.
13. Capstone projects - When interviewing any developer, one looks at their portfolio and what they have been able to do. Github plays a key role for from it one can tell the developer's portfolio and their activities. How often they have been uploading code to github.  Capstone projects will allow test your skills and at the end, one would have done lot's of personal projects that will standout from  everyone else inspite taking a similar course or been in the sam boot camp.
14. CSS - Stands for cascading style sheet where cascading refers to the approach of creating the styling in some sort of a water fall starting with the general styling to the most specific styling. Style Sheet - is a language similar to the markup language in html. There are different types of style sheet languages but for our case we will consider the cascading style sheet.
    Initially, In HTML 3 for formating and styling, various tags were added including, center, font, border etc which have since been deprecated. With such the code was a bit messed up and would be impossible to differentiate the content from the styling. This saw the recommendation of use of CSS to allow the separation of styling from content.
15. Adding CSS - We can add css in either of the three ways:
    1.  Inline - <tag style="css"> - Goes to the opening line of the tag. Uses the style attribute which has the property and the value of the property. e.g: <html style="background: blue"> </html>. This is however very tedious when working with several elements. It is therefore not recommended. - Used when targeting a single element
    2.  Internal - <style>css</style> - Done using special html tag called the style element:
            <html>
                <head>
                    <style>
                    html {
                        background: red;
                    }
                    </style>
                </head>
            </html>
            This can be used on any of the elements. All you need to add is a selector. The selector comes before the openning and closing curly braces. In the above the selector is html.
            -Used when targeting a single webpage.
    3.  External - <link href="style"> - With this approach, a file is created purely for creating all the styling and then called in between the <head></head> element. to add the css to the main file:
        <html>
            <head>
                <link rel = "stylesheet" href = "./styles.css">
            </head>
        </html>
    - Used when targeting an entire website with all its multiple web pages.
  
16. CSS Selectors - Through the property and value we can specify css rules. A CSS selector is the part that bundles the rules together e.g h1 in the below css:
    h1 {
        color: blue
    }
    - A CSS Selector is the path that selects the html in order to apply whichever rule that goes into the curly braces. 
    - An element selctor - selects/targets a specific html tag. It will select all elements of the selected tag.
    - Class selectors - use a . and any random name as the selector. e.g.
        .red-text {
            color: red
        }

        A class can then be added as an attribute to your elements for ablove: <h2 class="red-text">Red</h2>
        A class selector is really versatile for anables you to manipulate different elements in your web pages.
    - Id Selector - Uses the hash tag. It selects all the elements with a particular id attribute. Works similar to the class selector.
    - The difference btn the class and id selectors is:
      - The class selector can be added to many elements while the id selector should be applied to one element in a single html file. So if you have multiple <h2> elements and would like to add some different styling, the id selector would be best suited.
    - Attribute selector - We can add multiple attributes to an html tag e.g., <h1 id="" class="" draggable=""> etc. We can select elements that have particular attributes using below notation:
        h1[draggable] {
            color: red
        }
    this will select all h1 elements with attribute draggable and set the color to red.
    One can also be more specific and check the value of the property draggable as:

    <p draggable="true">Drag Me</p>
    <p draggable="false">Con't Drag Me</p>

    The css:
        p[draggable="false"] {
            color: red;
        }

    - Universal selector uses the asterisk. Which basically select all where the style sheet is active:
        * {
            color: red
          }

17. CSS Color properties - formated as property:value e.g., background-color:red or color:blue. These are name colors that can be found on the developer documentation on 
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/CSS/named-color. 
    
    As much as there are multiple colors available, you might want to work with a particular color palettes. One of the most popular ones being color hunt:
    https://colorhunt.co

    A free tool created by designers for designers shows the colors that work together perfectly. The colors have numbers and letters referred to as hexadecimal used to represent longer numbers. E.g purple can be represented as #5D3891 = rgb(93,56,145). The code can be used as an alternative to the name as:
        h1 {
            color: #5D3891
        }
    
18. Font Size - we can change various properties on our elements. For font we can use various properties including:
    1.  font-weight - can either be normal or bold. e.g., h1 {font-weight: normal}
            Bolder/Lighter - It can also be changed relative to the parent by using keewords bolder or lighter as values. Lighter less the weight by 100 while bolder makes it bolder by 100
            number - can also use a number between 100 and 900 to specify how bold you want it to be. 1q00 being the lighest and 900 the boldest.
    2.  font-size - can be changed as h1 {font-size:20px}. 1px = 1/96th inch or 0.26 mm which is absolutely tiny. Can also be represented in:
        a. points (1pt = 1/72nd inch or 0.35mm). 
        b. 1em - 100% of parent. This means if we set an <h1> tag to a font-size of 1em, and it is wrapped around a body tag with font-size:20px then the font-size of the <h1> will be 20px. if 2em then h1 will be set to 40px.
            <body style = "font-size: 20px">
                <h1 style = "font-size: 1em"> Hello World </h1>
            </body>

        c. 1rem - 100% of root. Works similar to the 1em but instead of being relative to the parent, it is relative to the root of the html file. With the html boiler plate, the root is always set to <html></html>. For 1rem, a change on its parent does not affect its size but if the root in this case the <html> tag font-size is changed, it will translate to an automatic change on the rem font sizes.

        Recommended to use the rem instead of using the em to avoid the confusion as a result of change of the size of elements.

    3.  font-family - Determines what you want your text to look like. e.g, font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif. 
        The first which is a Helvetica, is a mac font which might not be supported in some operating systems. Therefore, often in addition to the font name, a second value (generic font type). The san-serif usually has no decorations at the bottom but the edges of the letters are always at right angles. This means Mac users will see the Helvetica font while windows users will see an equivalent to Helvetica which in this case is sans-serif.

        if the type has more than one word e.g., Times New Roman, it must be specified in between double quotes to tell css there are spaces in the font family. Times New Roman being a serif, the backup should be set as so.

        To use a specific custom font in your project:
        Navigate to https://fonts.google.com/ select the specific font then click on it then click to select the specific weight that you intend to us. This will create specific links that you can then copy into the header section of your project and then use the fonts to your liking.
        Some of the generic fonts include:
            a. Helvetica
            b. arial
            c. Serif
            d. Sans serif
            e. cursive
            f. Monospace
            g. Fantasy

    4. Text Align - with this you can align text to the left, center, right, start (when you have text that is written from right to left e.g., in arabic) or end. Can check it out on MDN Docs.
    
 19. Inspecting CSS - When inspecting elements, one can easily play around with the styling, by adding new css elements, or modifying the already in place css. However, this does not affect the original source code. Can best be used to test out new features before effecting them on actual code.
    - When inspecting elements, on styles you will notice some of the css striked through. This is mostly because they have been overwritten by other custom code. If the custom styling for say the anchor tag is removed, then the default code is automatically activated.
    - To know they kind of formating applied to you code without the cancelled lines of code, use the computed tab of the inspected elements.
    - Sometimes you may come across a website you really like and would love to get an overview of what the styling is. To access such info, click the three dots on the developer tools (Not the chrome one), then click on more tools then click on CSS overview. This will show the background colors on your web page, the various fonts in use 

20. The Box Model (Margin, Padding and Border) - The three together with width and height form a very important concept known as the box model. Every element in a website is a box that can be changed by changing the width and height. 
    In adjusting, you can either use pixels or percentages. Can also set a border on the box with 3 values separated by space e.g., border: 10px solid black. Changing the border size does not change the size of the box. The border grows outwards and not inward. Can set different boarder values using the border-top, border-bottom etc. Or use the value border-with 0px 10px 20px 30px - This works in a clockwise marner starting at the top with 0px and the last value being assigned to the left as 30px.

    Can also set the top and bottom, left and right using the format:
        boarder-width: 0px 20px; - Top and bottom will be set to 0px while the other will be set to 20px.

    Padding - To the box, if padding is set to 20px, it will push the border out by 20px. The hight and width of the box does not change.
    Margin - is the part that is outside of the boarder. The margin is between the boarder and any other element on the screen. 
    
    From the outmost, the box model is as below:

                    Margin
                      |
                    border
                      |
                    Padding
                      |
        height & Width containing the content

    Padding and margin functions similar to the border styling  can use margin, margin-top, margin-bottom and margin-width 0px 10px 20px 30px. Same to padding.

    Other than boxes created by elements, we can also create our own elements. We use the content Division Element - DIV as <div> </div>
    They can take as many elements as you'd wish. This are usually invisible on the website and can at times be difficult to debug. To dubug such, you can use a free chrome extension <Pesticide Chrome Extension>. This will help diagnose what is wrong with your box model when it goes wrong.

    For p tags by default the element has a margin of 1em. If no margin is needed, always good practice to set the margin to zero for all <p></p>

    if not sure how any of the elements works, if you hover on it, VS code has a way of redirecting you to the MDN Docs where you can learn more about the element.
    
21. The cascading aspect of CSS comes out when you have multiple conflicting rules targetting the same element we must determine which one is way up on the hirarchy. The most important is usually the one the user sees on the screen. There are 4 types to consider when it comes to importance and within each there are different levels of importance as can be seen in "./Snips/CSS Order of Importance.png"
    1. Position - Here we check whether a rule is at a higher position or lower position in the css relative to the other rules: Consider:
        li {
            color: red;
            color: blue;
        }
    The blue will be the one seen in the screen since the lowest is the most important.

    2. Specificity - on specificity there is some sort of hirarchy when it comes to the various available option. At the very top and least important is:
        - Element say <li>
        - Class say .first-class
        - Attribute say li[draggable]
        - id say #first-id
    The id will take presidence over the rest and is considered the most important. The element basically applys to all <li>s while the class will apply to any element assigned the class name. The Attribute will check any whose attribute is set to draggble but since in a page convention dictates you should have only each element with a specific id, then it is the least identifier and hence the most specific and important.
    3. Type - This refers to the type of css. Below is their order from the least to the most important:
        - External css
        - Internal css
        - Inline css
    The inline css will override the rest of the css types
    4. Importance - a property can be assigned a value with the important keyward assigned to it. Consider:
    li {
        color: red;
        color: green !important;
    }

    the color of the <li> will be set to green since marked as so.

    Of the four, position is the least important type while the Importance is the most important and will tramp the rest of the types if set al together.

22. Combining CSS Selectors to target specifc elements to style - in some instances, you might be reqquired to assign a  different color to some elements in your code. Consider:
    
    <div class="box">
        <p>Yellow</p>
        <div class="inner-box">
            <h1>Yellow</h1>
            <p> white </p>
        </div>
        <p>Yellow</p>
    </div>
    
    The above can be styled using the css below:
    p {
        color: yellow;
    }
    .inner-box {
        Bankground-color: red;
    }

    .white-text {
        color: whhite
    }

    them add the class to any <p> to be that should be  white in color.

    However, so your code doesn't get cluttered with so many classes you can compine various selectors and still achieve the same goal. The above can instead be written as:

    p {
        color: yellow;
    }
    .inner-box {
        Bankground-color: red;
    }
    
    .inner-box p {
        color: whhite
    }
    
    Combiners:
    1. Coma <,>
    If multiple other elements are to be formatted similar to this element then you can add them separated by a coma. as:
    
    selector, selector, ... {

    }

    .inner-box p, h1 {
        color: white;
    }

    2. Right angle bracket '>' 
    Can be used to select the child to the element. On this you first specify the parent followed by the angle bracket then the child. The styling/relationship is one generation deep as:
    
    selector > selector {

    }

    e.g.,
    .box > p {
        color: firebrick;
    }

    3. Descendant combination <" ">
    Apply to a descendant of left side i.e.,

    selector selector {

    }

    e.g.,
    .box li {
        color: blue;
    }

    4. Chaining Selectors
    Apply where all selectors are true

    selectorselector {

    }

    For instance if you have several h1s in your code styled as below:
    <h1 id-"title" class="big heading">Hello world</h1>

    then to be very specific to such h1s you can use the chaining selector e.g.,

    h1#title.big.heading {

    }

    when using chaining, always start with the element. Starting with a class or an id selector might treat the chained styling as a class or id due to the . and # at the begining. There should be no spaces in between.

    5. combining combiners
    Imagine you wanted to select something that has an ancestor but then use chaining method woith a specifc selector in the format:

    selector selectorselector {

    }

    e.g.,
    
    ul p.done{
        font-size: 0.5rem;
    }

23. CSS Position (Relative, Absolute, Fixed and Static Positioning)
    - Static position - Is usually the default positioning of an element on a browser. Adding the left and top properties to the css with position set to static does not change anything. It is positioned right below whichever element that came before it. set as:
        div {
            position: static
        }
    - Relative Positioning - This is the positioning of an element relative to its default position on the browser. Set as:
        div {
            position: relative;
            left: 50px;
            top: 50 px
        }

    This is not set relative to any other element by relative to its default position. The above will be 50px from the left and shifted down by 50px.

    - Absolute Positioning - Position relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or top left corner of webpage i.e., If the ancestor does not have a position property, then the positioning will be relative to the top left corner of your web page.
      - Z-index - for instance with the absolute position, the box by default sits on top of other divs / elements on the browser. The Z-index comes in when you do not want it to sit on top of other elements. by default the z-index is set to 0. Vhanging it to negative will perfom the trick for you.
    - Fixed Positioning - Is relative to the top left corner of yourbrowser window. It is somehow similar to the absolute until you start scrolling. On scrolling the position remains static and does not change while absolute moves with the page.

SECTION 8: ADVANCED CSS
24. CSS Display - By default, when an element is added to a webpage, it covers the entire width. However, in some instances one may wish to have them side by side. or style some word within a p tag. Consider:
    <h2>Harry</h>
    <h2>Potter</h>

This will be shown as two lines. This is because by default the display property is set to block. 
    h2 {
        display:block;
    }

To have them on one line, this property must be set to inline:
    h2 {
        display: inline;
    }

To change the styling of a word(s) in between a p tag, we use the <span></span> tag. It can be used in between any elements.

There are three types of display values:
   1. Block - display: block takes the entire width, if you have another element it will go below it.
   2. Inline - display: inline takes multiple elements until it can no longer fit in the width of the webpage then go to the next line. You can't set the width and height of the inline it will adjust to the length of the word.
   3. inline-block - is a blend of the two and it allows set the height and width and the inline bit allows add elements go to the same line. Changing the block will help change the layout of our website.
   4. None - display: none - This makes the element disappear. Useful when you have a button or checkoff an element on the todo list and want it to disappear.

Allows for responsiveness- Very key.

25. CSS Float - wrapping text using float and clear.
    If we want our text to wrap around another element we will require the float property.
    Assuming you have an <img> tag followed by a <p> tag, if one of the float: left property is added to the <img> tag, then part of the text in the <p> tag will be added to the right of the image then the rest go under it. No value to be set on the <p> tag.

    <img/>
    <p>text.......</p>

    style.css:
    img {
        float: right
    }

    text will be formatted as:

    <img>...................................
    ........................................
    ........................................

    The opposite applies if the value was set to right.

    In a case where you have a footer, it may look weird if it was to float next to the rest of the text. Convention dictates that it should be below the rest of the content. We therefore need to clear the floating effect for the footed tag as:

    footer {
        cleare: left;
    }

    This will clear anything that is floating.

    In modern development we do not use the float feature to achieve the various designs. We can instead make use of Flex, Grid, bootstrap and lots of other things better than float. Only use float when wrapping text around an image but not on everything else.

26. How to Create Responsive Websites: 
    This days there are different screensizes so it can respond to changes on the screen size. There are various ways to do this, including:
    - Media Queries
    - CSS Grid
    - CSS Flexbox
    - External Frameworks e.g. Bootstrap
    
    1. Media Queries
        This is used as a selector. e.g.,
            @media (max-width: 600px) {
                /*CSS for screens below or equal to 600px */
            }

        This says look into the braces and apply the css when displaying on a screen equal to or less than 600px.

    2. CSS Grid:
        Divs can be used to create a grid with different containers and in different formarts. The end result/layout dictates the number of divs to be created. where each can be given the same class say card but each receives a different style. They are then all wrapped withing a parent css that has the property display set to grid. e.g:

        <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="first card"></div>
            <div class="card"></div>
            <div class="card"></div>
            <div class="card"></div>
            <div class="card"></div>
        </div>

        And the css set to:

        .grid-container {
            display: none;
            grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr //defines that we will have two columns both 1 fraction. equal in size
            grid-template-rows: 100px 200px 200px // top row height 100px while the rest are 200px 
            gap:30px //There should be a gap of 30px btn each row and column.
        }

        .first {
            grid-column: span 2; //Change the first div so the column can span two columns. Achieves full width
        }

        .card {
            background-color: blue
        }

    3. CSS Flexbox
        If grid is something that applies to 2D layauts, where you have columns and rows, flexbox allows create 1D layouts where you either want things laid out in horizontally or vertically as boxes then you are likely to use flexbox. e.g:

        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="first card"></div>
            <div class="second card"></div>
            <div class="card"></div>
            <div class="card"></div>
            <div class="card"></div>
        </div>

        .flex-container {
            display: none;
        }

        .card {
            background: blue;
            border: 30px solid white;
            height: 100px;
            flex: 1;
        }

        .first {
            flex: 2;
        }

        .second {
            flex: 0.5;
        }

        This is about dividing the width and height by some ratio you specify. And because everything is a ratio and a percentage then it will always be responsive. Works the size by getting a percentage of the total width.


    4. Bootstrap Framework
        It is a framework because it is external to css. They have written extensive CSS code with predefined styling. Bootstrap is built on top of flex boxes and divide you webpage into 12 division system. e.g:

        <div class="container>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="card col-6"> //Picks the first half of your page - 6 of the 13 sections
                    Card
                </div>
                <div class="card col-2"> //Takes 2 of the columns
                    Card
                </div>
                <div class="card col-4"> //Takes 4 of the remaining columns
                    Card
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        This adjusts accordingly when working with smaller devices.

27. Media Queries
    Used to set the styling for different screen sizes. Can set use to set the max-width or min-width:

    1. Max-width 
        @media (max-width: 600px) {
            h1 {
                font-size: 25px
            }
        }

        The above code will apply on a screen size less than or equal to 600px whereas the code below will target bigger screens with this minimum width.

    2. min-width
        @media (min-width: 600px) {
            h1 {
                font-size: 25px
            }
        }

        Can also target a specific size as:

    3. Combined
        @media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 900px) {
            /* Styles for screens between 600px and 900px */
        }

        The two can still be flipped as:

        @media (max-width: 600px) and (min-width: 900px) {
            /* Styles for screens between 600px and 900px */
        }

        This will apply similar styling to anything less than or equal to 600px and above 900px.

     4.  Device
        Might use screen to mean all screens whose alternative is print. Used when printing your screen. Not recommended to have this in your code. It takes the format:

            @media screen(orientation: landscape) {
                /* Styles for landscape orientation */
            }

    This are the most used.
